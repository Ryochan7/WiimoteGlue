#This is a sample file to help demonstrate WiimoteGlue
#Any of these commands can be entered on STDIN,
#or loaded from a file.
#Clearly the "#" lets you make comments.
#
#This demonstration is still a bit confusing...
#It needs some work!

#WiimoteGlue works under a system of modes.
#Each mode has its own control mapping.

#The map command sets control mappings, it has this format:
#   map <mode> <wii input event> <gamepad output event>

map nunchuk up up
map nunchuk down down
map nunchuk left left
map nunchuk right right

#the above commands map the dpad to the virtual dpad when
#a nunchuk is plugged in. 
#The word nunchuk above refers to 
#"do this when the nunchuk is plugged in" 
#Note that "up" still refers to the dpad, which is
#not on the nunchuk, it is on the wiimote.

map wiimote up left
map wiimote left down
map wiimote right up
map wiimote down right

#The above commands have maped the dpad to the virtual dpad
#when no extension is present. However, it is mapped "sideways".

#Now when a nunchuk is plugged in, the dpad will be mapped 
#"normally", but as soon as you remove the nunchuk,
#the dpad will switch to the sideways mapping, without 
#any extra effort. Pretty handy! Let's add some other buttons:

map wiimote a south
map wiimote b east
map nunchuk b tr2
map nunchuk a south

#Now when the wiimote is alone, the B button acts like
#a face button (east). Once the nunchuk is plugged in,
#the B button becomes the right trigger.

#Hopefully the usefulness is becoming clear.
#There is one other mode, "classic". It used when either
#a classic controller is plugged in, or for the Wii U pro
#controller.

#in both modes, the "A" button on the wiimote was
#maped to "south", the primary action button
#on the virtual gamepad.

#you can also map the accelerometers based on mode

map wiimote accely left_x invert

#This is a useful mapping for tilting a horizontal wiimote
#left and right. Notice the optional "invert" at the end
#to reverse the direction.
#
#However, even when mapped, the accelerometers are off
#by default

enable wiimote accel
#"disable wiimote accel" to turn them off

#Note that wiimote here refers to the mode, not the device.
#"enable nunchuk accel" would activate the wiimote (and nunchuk)
#accelerometers when a nunchuk is plugged in.

#"ir" is another feature that is off by default.

#enter in "help" for all commands.
#enter in "events" to see all recongized event names
#        for use with the "map" command.
#similarly, "features" reminds you about the recognized
#        features to enable/disable.
#enter in "modes" to see the different mode names.
