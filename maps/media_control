#This file shows how one might like
#to set a wiimote to control one's media

#first, lets change player 1 to simulate a keyboard
#One can also do "assign <devname> keyboardmouse"

slot 1 keyboardmouse

#Keyboard and mouse events only work if one
#these two cases are true:
#  -The device's slot is set to keyboardmouse mode
#  -The device is directly assigned to the keyboardmouse slot

#These buttons are sensible in all the modes:
map keyboardmouse all plus key_volumeup
map keyboardmouse all minus key_volumedown

#Note that we must specify the name of the mapping
#"keyboardmouse", otherwise it will default to
#the "gamepad" mapping.


#lets hold the wiimote vertically, like a remote.

map keyboardmouse wiimote a key_playpause
map keyboardmouse wiimote b key_mute
map keyboardmouse wiimote left key_previoussong
map keyboardmouse wiimote right key_nextsong
map keyboardmouse wiimote home key_stop
map keyboardmouse wiimote 1 key_shuffle
map keyboardmouse wiimote up key_brightnessup
map keyboardmouse wiimote down key_brightnessdown

#add a nunchuk, and we'll add some mouse controls as well.

enable keyboardmouse nunchuk ir
map keyboardmouse nunchuk ir_x mouse_x

#What should we do with a classic controller?
#This file is more of a demo than an
#actually useful setup.
