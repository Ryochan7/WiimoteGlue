#This is a sample file to help demonstrate WiimoteGlue
#Any of these commands can be entered on STDIN,
#or loaded from a file.
#Clearly the # lets you make comments.

#WiimoteGlue works under a system of modes.
#Each mode has its own control mapping.

#assing sets control mappings, it has this format:
#   assign <mode> <wii input event> <gamepad output event>

assign nunchuk up up
assign nunchuk down down
assign nunchuk left left
assign nunchuk right right

#the above commands assign the dpad to the virtual dpad when
#a nunchuk is plugged in. The word nunchuk above refers
#to the mode "nunchuk is plugged in" while the input "up"
#refers to the dpad up button on the wiimote.
#(The nunchuk itself has no dpad!)

assign wiimote up left
assign wiimote left down
assign wiimote right up
assign wiimote down right

#The above commands have assigned the dpad to the virtual dpad
#when no extension is present. However, it is mapped "sideways".

#Now when a nunchuk is plugged in, the dpad will be mapped 
#"normally", but as soon as you remove the nunchuk,
#the dpad will switch to the sideways mapping, without 
#any extra effort. Pretty handy! Let's add some other buttons:

assign wiimote a south
assign wiimote b east
assign wiimote b tr2

#Now when the wiimote is alone, the B button acts like
#a face button (east). Once the nunchuk is plugged in,
#the B button becomes the right trigger.

#Hopefully the usefulness is becoming clear.
#There is one other mode, "classic". It used when either
#a classic controller is plugged in, or for the Wii U pro
#controller.

#you can also assign the accelerometers based on mode

assign wiimote accely left_x invert

#This is a useful mapping for tilting a horizontal wiimote
#left and right. Notice the optional "invert" at the end
#to reverse the direction.
#
#However, even when mapped, the accelerometers are off
#by default

enable wiimote accel
#"disable wiimote accel" to turn them off

#Note that wiimote here refers to the mode, not the device.
#"enable nunchuk accel" would activate the wiimote (and nunchuk)
#accelerometers when a nunchuk is plugged in.

#"ir" is another feature that is off by default.

#enter in "help" for all commands.
#enter in "events" to see all recongized event names
#        for use with the "assign" command.
#similarly, "features" reminds you about the recognized
#        features to enable/disable.
#enter in "modes" to see the different mode names.
